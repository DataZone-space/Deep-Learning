Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of Machine Learning specializing in the use of Artificial Neural Networks to imitate the thinking functions of the “Neurons” in a human brain. The topics I write about go deep into Simple Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks as well as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing.
